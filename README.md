# README

* Day 1: a short easy one to start confortably the adventure
* Day 2: too tired to find an elegant solution ü•≤
* Day 3: regular expression and finding indexes
* Day 4: a missed opportunity to use named tuples. Next time!
* Day 5: I refactored day 4!
* Day 6: took me quite a long time to figure out what I was missing.
* Day 7: I didn't lose any time today üòÅ
* Day 8: I was expecting a totally different part 2
* Day 9: `boundary`, multiple nested `while` loops, absolutely unreadable code but it works!
* Day 10: chill one!
* Day 11: I originally had the correct idea, but I went astray before going back to it.
* Day 12: I think the way I solved part 1 made part 2 easy (while still being more complicated that it could have been)
* Day 13: good old linear algebra
* Day 14: solving part 2 required a small font size for the console
* Day 15: I should rewrite `moveTilesVertically` for clarity but... "oh well, it works!"
* Day 16: far from optimized... takes a few seconds to compute
