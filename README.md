# README

* Day 1: a short easy one to start confortably the adventure
* Day 2: too tired to find an elegant solution 🥲
* Day 3: regular expression and finding indexes
* Day 4: a missed opportunity to use named tuples. Next time!
* Day 5: I refactored day 4!
* Day 6: took me quite a long time to figure out what I was missing.
* Day 7: I didn't lose any time today 😁
* Day 8: I was expecting a totally different part 2
* Day 9: `boundary`, multiple nested `while` loops, absolutely unreadable code but it works!
